App Engine application for the Udacity training course:  
[Developing Scalable Apps in Python with Google App Engine][8]  
For detailed project specifications from Udacity see this [document][9].  
## Products
- [App Engine][1]

## Language
- [Python][2]

## APIs
- [Google Cloud Endpoints][3]

## Setup Instructions
1. Update the value of `application` in `app.yaml` to the app ID you
   have registered in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host
   your instance of this sample.
1. Update the values at the top of `settings.py` to
   reflect the respective client IDs you have registered in the
   [Developer Console][4].
1. Update the value of CLIENT_ID in `static/js/app.js` to the Web client ID
1. (Optional) Mark the configuration files as unchanged as follows:
   `$ git update-index --assume-unchanged app.yaml settings.py static/js/app.js`
1. Run the app with the devserver using `dev_appserver.py DIR`, and ensure it's running by visiting your local server's address (by default [localhost:8080][5].)
1. (Optional) Generate your client library(ies) with [the endpoints tool][6].
1. Deploy your application.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop additional functionality for the back-end of a limited Conference Management Application. The point is to excercise the functionality provided by Google App Engine, especially related to [Cloud Endpoints][10] and the Google NoSQL [Cloud Datastore][11]. Other functionality from App Engine, such as [Task Queues][12], [Cron Jobs][13], [Memcache][15] as well as managing and monitoring using the [Google Developers Console][14] are also part of the excercises for this project.

## Navigating project files
Most of the code written for this project is concentrated in the following files:

*  **apps.yaml:** the configuration file for the application. In addition to this file, **settings.py** is where support for additional front-end clients such as iOS and Andriod can be easily plugged in.
*  **models.py:** data modeling for Datastore entities, as well as, form classes used for handling requests and providing responses to clients.
*  **conference.py:** implementation of all endpoints that clients can call into via Remote Procedure Call functionality from the App Engine.
*  **cron.yaml, main.py:** configuration file as well as code stub for task queues and cron jobs that are implemented in apps.yaml.
*  **index.yaml:** autogenerated indexes for datastore.

## Tasks implemented for this project
The following tasks were completed based on the [specifications][9]:

### Support for Conference Sessions
The data model and form class for session support is provided in **models.py**. Session has an ancestor which is the Conference where the session is held. The method *_createSessionObject()* in **conference.py** does the work to instanciate session entities and form objects. This is where the unique key for session entities are assigned based on the unique conference key which is the ancestor of the session. The session name is the only required property, other properties are assigned default values as part of handling the client request for creating a new session. For this project the Session Speaker is implemented as a simple string property, and the Session Type is an enum property. In addition to the typical properties for the session, a "Popularity" integer property was also included to support another task in this project. The popularity is incremented as users add sessions to their wish list. The following Endpoints methods were implemented in **conference.py** to privide Session functionality for the Conference App:
*  **getConferenceSessions(websafeConferenceKey)** -- Given a conference, return all sessions
*  **getConferenceSessionsByType(websafeConferenceKey, typeOfSession)** Given a conference, return all sessions of a specified type (eg lecture, keynote, workshop)
*  **getSessionsBySpeaker(speaker)** -- Given a speaker, return all sessions given by this particular speaker, across all conferences
*  **createSession(SessionForm, websafeConferenceKey)** -- open only to the organizer of the conference
